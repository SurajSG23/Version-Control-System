# Version Control System (VCS)

A **Version Control System** is a tool that helps track changes to files (especially code) over time.  
It allows multiple developers to work together without overwriting each other’s work.  

### Benefits:
- Tracks history of changes
- Supports collaboration
- Allows rollback to previous versions
- Manages branches for parallel development
- Prevents code conflicts

# Git
**Git** is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds (2005).  
It allows developers to keep a local copy of the project and sync with a remote repository.

### Key Features:
- Distributed (every developer has a full copy of repo)
- Lightweight branching & merging
- Tracks changes efficiently
- Works offline

---

# GitHub
**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.  
It provides collaboration features and project management tools.

### Key Features:
- Host Git repositories online
- Collaborate with teams
- Pull requests (PRs) & code reviews
- Issues & project boards
- Actions (CI/CD automation)

---

*With Git + GitHub, developers can build, track, and collaborate efficiently on any project.*

---
# GitLab
GitLab is a **web-based DevOps platform** that provides **Git repository hosting** along with **built-in CI/CD, issue tracking, and project management tools** — all in one application.
It’s similar to GitHub but focuses more on **complete DevOps lifecycle integration** (from code to deployment).

---

### **Key Features**

**1. Git Repository Management**

* Host and manage Git repositories.
* Supports branching, merging, and pull requests (called *merge requests*).

**2. Built-in CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)**

* Automates testing, building, and deployment pipelines directly within GitLab.
* No need for separate CI/CD tools — it’s built-in.

**3. Issue Tracking & Project Management**

* Track bugs, tasks, and milestones.
* Create project boards and workflows similar to Jira or Trello.

**4. Self-Hosting Option**

* Can be installed on your own server (unlike GitHub, which is mainly cloud-hosted).
* Gives full control over data, security, and customization.

**5. DevSecOps Integration**

* Includes tools for **security scanning, container registry, and monitoring**.

**6. Collaboration Features**

* Merge requests, code reviews, and inline comments.
* Supports team permissions and project visibility control.

---

**In short:** \
**GitLab = Git + Full DevOps tools (code → test → deploy → monitor)**
Perfect for teams that want **one integrated platform** for both development and deployment.
