# Version Control System (VCS)

A **Version Control System** is a tool that helps track changes to files (especially code) over time.  
It allows multiple developers to work together without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.  

### Benefits:
- Tracks history of changes
- Supports collaboration
- Allows rollback to previous versions
- Manages branches for parallel development
- Prevents code conflicts

It allows developers to keep a local copy of the project and sync with a remote repository.

### Key Features:
- Distributed (every developer has a full copy of repo)
- Lightweight branching & merging
- Tracks changes efficiently

## GitHub
**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.  
It provides collaboration features and project management tools.

### Key Features:
- Host Git repositories online
- Collaborate with teams
