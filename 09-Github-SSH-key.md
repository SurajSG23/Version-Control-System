## 🔹 What is SSH?

**SSH** stands for **Secure Shell**.
It’s a *secure communication protocol* that lets you connect to remote systems (like servers or GitHub) **safely and privately** over the internet.

Think of it like a secure “tunnel” that encrypts all your data between your computer and another machine.

In the context of **GitHub**, SSH is used to:

* Authenticate you securely without entering your username/password every time.
* Allow Git operations (clone, push, pull) via encrypted connection.

So instead of using:

```
https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

you use:

```
git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

## 🔹 Step-by-Step: Set Up SSH for GitHub

### **Step 1 — Check if you already have an SSH key**

Open a terminal or Git Bash and run:

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

If you see files like `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub`, you already have a key pair.

---

### **Step 2 — Generate a new SSH key (if needed)**

Run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* `-t ed25519` → creates a modern, secure key type
* `-C` → adds a label (your email) for identification

When prompted for a file location, just press **Enter** to accept default (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
You can also set a passphrase (optional, for extra security).

This creates:

* **Private key:** `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` (keep it secret)
* **Public key:** `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (this goes to GitHub)

---

### **Step 3 — Start the SSH agent and add your private key**

This allows your system to remember and use the key.

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

---

### **Step 4 — Add your public key to GitHub**

1. Copy your public key:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

   Copy the whole line that starts with `ssh-ed25519`.

2. Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key**

3. Paste the key and give it a title (like “My Laptop”).

---

### **Step 5 — Test your connection**

Run:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If successful, you’ll see:

```
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

---

### **Step 6 — Use SSH for Git commands**

From now on, use the SSH URL when cloning:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

Or switch an existing repo from HTTPS to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

---

### **Step 7 — Done!**

You can now `git push`, `git pull`, or `git clone` without typing your GitHub password every time.
SSH handles authentication securely for you.
